| French musician Jean-Michel Jarre is to perform at a concert in Copenhagen to mark the bicentennial of the birth of writer Hans Christian Andersen...Denmark is holding a three-day celebration of the life of the fairy-tale author, with a concert at Parken stadium on 2 April. Other stars are expected to join the line-up in the coming months, and the Danish royal family will attend. "Christian Andersen's fairy tales are timeless and universal," said Jarre. "For all of us, at any age there is always - beyond the pure enjoyment of the tale - a message to learn." There are year-long celebrations planned across the world to celebrate Andersen and his work, which includes The Emperor's New Clothes and The Little Mermaid. Denmark's Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary visited New York on Monday to help promote the festivities. The pair were at a Manhattan library to honour US literary critic Harold Bloom "the international icon we thought we knew so well"..."Bloom recognizes the darker aspects of Andersen's authorship," Prince Frederik said. Bloom is to be formally presented with the Hans Christian Andersen Award this spring in Anderson's hometown of Odense. The royal couple also visited the Hans Christian Anderson School complex, where Queen Mary read The Ugly Duckling to the young audience. Later at a gala dinner, Danish supermodel Helena Christensen was named a Hans Christian Andersen ambassador. Other ambassadors include actors Harvey Keitel and Sir Roger Moore, athlete Cathy Freeman and Brazilian soccer legend Pele.| french musician jeanmichel jarre is to perform at a concert in copenhagen to mark the bicentennial of the birth of writer hans christian andersendenmark is holding a threeday celebration of the life of the fairytale author with a concert at parken stadium on 2 april other stars are expected to join the lineup in the coming months and the danish royal family will attend christian andersens fairy tales are timeless and universal said jarre for all of us at any age there is always  beyond the pure enjoyment of the tale  a message to learn there are yearlong celebrations planned across the world to celebrate andersen and his work which includes the emperors new clothes and the little mermaid denmarks crown prince frederik and crown princess mary visited new york on monday to help promote the festivities the pair were at a manhattan library to honour us literary critic harold bloom the international icon we thought we knew so wellbloom recognizes the darker aspects of andersens authorship prince frederik said bloom is to be formally presented with the hans christian andersen award this spring in andersons hometown of odense the royal couple also visited the hans christian anderson school complex where queen mary read the ugly duckling to the young audience later at a gala dinner danish supermodel helena christensen was named a hans christian andersen ambassador other ambassadors include actors harvey keitel and sir roger moore athlete cathy freeman and brazilian soccer legend pele | 
| The plot of an international bestseller that thousands of readers are likely to receive as a Christmas present is 'laughable', a clergyman has said...The Da Vinci Code claims Jesus was not crucified, but married Mary Magdalene and died a normal death. It claims this was later covered up by the Church. The Bishop of Durham, the Rt Rev Dr Tom Wright, described the novel as a "great thriller" but "lousy history". The book has sold more than seven million copies worldwide. Despite enjoying Dan Brown's conspiracy theory, the Bishop said there was a lack of evidence to back up its claims...Writing his Christmas message in the Northern Echo, the Bishop said: "Conspiracy theories are always fun - fun to invent, fun to read, fun to fantasise about. "Dan Brown is the best writer I've come across in the genre, but anyone who knows anything about 1st century history will see that this underlying material is laughable." A great deal of credible evidence proves the Biblical version of Jesus' life was true, according to the Bishop. "The evidence for Jesus and the origins of Christianity is astonishingly good," he said. "We have literally a hundred times more early manuscripts for the gospels and letters in the New Testament than we have for the main classical authors like Cicero, Virgil and Tacitus..."Historical research shows that they present a coherent and thoroughly credible picture of Jesus, with all sorts of incidental details that fit the time when he lived, and don't fit the world of later legend." Brown's book has become a publishing phenomenon, consistently topping book charts in the UK and US. The Da Vinci Code has been translated into 42 languages and has spawned its own cottage industry of publications, including guides on to how to read the book, rebuttals and counter claims. The book, which has become an international best-seller in little over two years, is set to be made into a film starring Tom Hanks. | the plot of an international bestseller that thousands of readers are likely to receive as a christmas present is laughable a clergyman has saidthe da vinci code claims jesus was not crucified but married mary magdalene and died a normal death it claims this was later covered up by the church the bishop of durham the rt rev dr tom wright described the novel as a great thriller but lousy history the book has sold more than seven million copies worldwide despite enjoying dan browns conspiracy theory the bishop said there was a lack of evidence to back up its claimswriting his christmas message in the northern echo the bishop said conspiracy theories are always fun  fun to invent fun to read fun to fantasise about dan brown is the best writer ive come across in the genre but anyone who knows anything about 1st century history will see that this underlying material is laughable a great deal of credible evidence proves the biblical version of jesus life was true according to the bishop the evidence for jesus and the origins of christianity is astonishingly good he said we have literally a hundred times more early manuscripts for the gospels and letters in the new testament than we have for the main classical authors like cicero virgil and tacitushistorical research shows that they present a coherent and thoroughly credible picture of jesus with all sorts of incidental details that fit the time when he lived and dont fit the world of later legend browns book has become a publishing phenomenon consistently topping book charts in the uk and us the da vinci code has been translated into 42 languages and has spawned its own cottage industry of publications including guides on to how to read the book rebuttals and counter claims the book which has become an international bestseller in little over two years is set to be made into a film starring tom hanks |

| A Christmas tree that can receive text messages has been unveiled at London's Tate Britain art gallery...The spruce has an antenna which can receive Bluetooth texts sent by visitors to the Tate. The messages will be "unwrapped" by sculptor Richard Wentworth, who is responsible for decorating the tree with broken plates and light bulbs. It is the 17th year that the gallery has invited an artist to dress their Christmas tree. Artists who have decorated the Tate tree in previous years include Tracey Emin in 2002...The plain green Norway spruce is displayed in the gallery's foyer. Its light bulb adornments are dimmed, ordinary domestic ones joined together with string. The plates decorating the branches will be auctioned off for the children's charity ArtWorks. Wentworth worked as an assistant to sculptor Henry Moore in the late 1960s. His reputation as a sculptor grew in the 1980s, while he has been one of the most influential teachers during the last two decades. Wentworth is also known for his photography of mundane, everyday subjects such as a cigarette packet jammed under the wonky leg of a table.| a christmas tree that can receive text messages has been unveiled at londons tate britain art gallerythe spruce has an antenna which can receive bluetooth texts sent by visitors to the tate the messages will be unwrapped by sculptor richard wentworth who is responsible for decorating the tree with broken plates and light bulbs it is the 17th year that the gallery has invited an artist to dress their christmas tree artists who have decorated the tate tree in previous years include tracey emin in 2002the plain green norway spruce is displayed in the gallerys foyer its light bulb adornments are dimmed ordinary domestic ones joined together with string the plates decorating the branches will be auctioned off for the childrens charity artworks wentworth worked as an assistant to sculptor henry moore in the late 1960s his reputation as a sculptor grew in the 1980s while he has been one of the most influential teachers during the last two decades wentworth is also known for his photography of mundane everyday subjects such as a cigarette packet jammed under the wonky leg of a table |
