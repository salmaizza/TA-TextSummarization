|['A judge has dismissed an attempt by Russian oil giant Yukos to gain bankruptcy protection in the US...Yukos filed for Chapter 11 protection in Houston in an unsuccessful attempt to halt the auction of its Yugansk division by the Russian authorities.', 'The court ruling is a blow to efforts to get damages for the sale of Yugansk, which Yukos claims was illegally sold.', 'Separately, former Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky began testimony on Friday in his trial for fraud and tax evasion...Mr Khodorkovsky - who has been in jail for more than a year - pleaded not guilty to the charges brought against him and denied involvement in any criminal activities.', '"I pride myself on heading for 15 years a number of successful companies and helping other enterprises rise from their knees," he told a Russian court...Yugansk was auctioned to help pay off $27.5bn (£14.5bn) in unpaid taxes.', 'It was bought for $9.4bn by a previously-unknown group, which was in turn bought up almost immediately by state-controlled oil company Rosneft...Texas Judge Letitia Clark said Yukos did not have enough of a US presence to establish US jurisdiction.', '"The vast majority of the business and financial activities of Yukos continue to occur in Russia," Judge Clark said in her ruling.', 'Yukos had argued that a US court was entitled to declare it bankrupt before its Yugansk unit was sold, since it has local bank accounts and its chief finance officer Bruce Misamore lives in Houston.']|
